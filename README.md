# Broken Wish?: Gauging the Effectiveness of Wish's Product Promotion

## Blog Version


# Summary
My name is Christian Rios-Chambi and I am a Data Analyst working for the e-commerce company Wish. My presentation will be on gauging the effectiveness of Wish’s product promotions. Wish is an American online e-commerce company. As of 2019 Wish is the third-biggest e-commerce marketplace in the United States by sales. So what makes Wish unique from it’s competitors? Instead of using traditional search bar format, customers use tags (keywords) to find the products they are looking for. Also a wide variety of merchants can list their products on Wish and can sell directly to the consumer (at high discount rates), avoiding the preverbal middlemen. There are three main product promotions that I want to investigate and I want to see if I can predict units sold using the tag count of the product.

## **Here are the promotions** 
- **Ad boosts**
- **Product badges**
- **Tag count (the number of keyword associations to a product)**



**Ad Boost** 

*Ad Boost is the native advertising platform of Wish Marketplace. It is a PAID SERVICE for merchants*

**Product badges** 

*There are three product badges offered on the Wish Platform.*

**Product Quality Badge:** 

*it can only be given to a product that has high ratings, high sales, and a low refund ratio.*

**Fast Shipping Badge:** 

*It is given to a product that can be rapidly shipped to the customer.*

**Local Product Badge:** 

*The product was made in the country of the customer.*

**Tag Count** 

*Merchants set which tags and how many tags they want associated with their products.*

# Objectives
- Are ad boosts increasing product revenue?
- Are product badges increasing product revenue?
- Does the tag count have an effect on product revenue?
- Can we predict the units sold of a product by just looking at its tag count?
